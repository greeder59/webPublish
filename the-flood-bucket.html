    <p>Much is said and written about preparing for the Zombie Apocalypse.  We talk about Go Bags, EDC Bags, etc. But what about the smaller disasters? Like a flood. Unless you have experienced it, you have no idea what a smelly stinky mess a flood can leave behind. The Flood Bucket is like a Go Bag, except it's to prepare you for the aftermath of a flood. The idea of the Flood Bucket comes from the Oregon Conference Adventist Community Services Disaster Response team. </p>
<p>Start with a 5 gallon bucket with a tight fitting lid. Place the following items into the bucket:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 Scouring pads</li>
<li>7 or more sponges of varying sizes. Include at least one large car wash sponge.</li>
<li>1 or 2 scrub brush(es)</li>
<li>18 cleaning towels. Or a roll of shop rags like you get at an auto parts store.</li>
<li>1 large or two small bottles of liquid laundry detergent.</li>
<li>1 bottle of household cleaner.</li>
<li>1 bottle of liquid dish soap (disinfectant).</li>
<li>1 small bottle of household bleach</li>
<li>100 feet of clothes line.</li>
<li>50 clothes pins.</li>
<li>5 dust masks.</li>
<li>2 or 3 pair of heavy latex gloves.</li>
<li>1 or 2 pair of heavy work gloves.</li>
<li>1 roll of heavy duty trash bags, 30 to 45 gallon size.</li>
<li>1 can insect repellent.</li>
<li>1 can air freshener.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pack all these items into the bucket and put the lid on. Label the bucket and store it somewhere where it won't float away in a flood. You might want to attach it to the wall with a bungee cord.</p>
<p>The Flood Bucket is intended to help you recover from a flood. However, you will find these household cleaners useful during any crisis.</p>
<p>There are some other things you will need 
that won't fit in the Flood Bucket. These should be tied together, attached to the wall and stored near the Flood Bucket.</p>
<ul>
<li>A couple of self wringing mops</li>
<li>A couple of extra buckets</li>
<li>A scoop type shovel</li>
<li>A squeegee</li>
</ul>
<p>Adventist Community Services suggests making up several Flood Buckets and storing them at your church or school. It can then be given to a family who experiences a flood or similar disaster. </p>
