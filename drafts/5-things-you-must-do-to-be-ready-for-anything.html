    <p>Every day we go about our lives. Wakeup, Eat breakfast, Drop kids at school, Go to work, etc. It's the same old day in, day out routine. But what happens when that routine is interrupted? Would you be ready? would you know what to do?</p>
<p>In this article I will tell you 5 steps that you need to take to be ready for anything.</p>
<h2>Educate yourself</h2>
<p>Congratulations, By reading this, you are already taking the first step. That puts you one step ahead of the vast majority of the population.</p>
<p>Start by asking yourself "What's the worst that can happen?" Are you thinking Zombie Apocalypse, war, the general collapse of civilization? While those situations are remotely possible, they are not very likely. Instead, think about specific threats, like weather: wind storm, hurricane, rain storm, blizzard, flooding. While you are at it, think about earthquakes, landslides, sinkholes, and wild fires. </p>
<p>Now think about how these events will disrupt your life. Wind and ice, for instance can bring down power lines. Fallen trees will block roads making travel difficult. </p>
<p>Your county's web site should have a link to their emergency management department. There you should find a comprehensive list of the hazards your area is likely to face and their expected impact.</p>
<h2>Make a plan</h2>
<h2>Communicate</h2>
<h2>Eat and drink</h2>
<h2>Keep warm</h2>
